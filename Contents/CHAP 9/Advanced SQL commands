1. Timestamps and Extract
  - SELECT extract(day from payment_date) AS day FROM payment;
  
  - SELECT SUM(amount), extract(month from payment_date) AS month
    FROM payment
    GROUP BY month
    ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;

2. mathematical functions
  - SELECT  rental_id / customer_id AS new_id FROM payment;
  - SELECT round(AVG(amount), 2) FROM payment;

3. String function and operators
  - SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name FROM customer;
  -> || means concatenate strings (It's weird :D)
  - SELECT lower(first_name), char_length(first_name), upper(last_name), char_length(last_name)
    FROM customer;
  -> lower(), upper(), char_length()

4. subquery
  - SELECT AVG(rental_rate) FROM film;
  
    SELECT title, rental_rate
    FROM film
    WHERE rental_rate > 2.98;
    -> How to combine 2 queries
  - SELECT title, rental_rate
    FROM film
    WHERE rental_rate > (SELECT AVG(rental_rate) FROM film);
  -> Put second query in parentheses
  
  - Ex2:
  SELECT film_id, title
  FROM film
  WHERE film_id IN
  (SELECT inventory.film_id 
  FROM rental
  INNER JOIN inventory ON inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id
  WHERE
  return_date BETWEEN '2005-05-29' AND '2005-05-30')
  -> Quite complicated

5. selfjoin  
- Combine row with other rows within the same table
